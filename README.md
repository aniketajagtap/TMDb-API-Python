# TMDb-API-Python
This repository contains a comprehensive TMDB API integration project that enables developers to interact with The Movie Database (TMDB) API and retrieve movie-related data. The TMDB API offers a rich set of endpoints to access a vast collection of movies, TV shows, actors, and more.

## For this project, we are using the TMDb (The Movie Database) API.
TMDb API enables you to find out the latest information about TV Shows, Movies and the biggest names in entertainment sector for a marvelous and fun TV/Movie watching experience.

## Our Motivation for using TMDb API
